1. Install Arduino IDE v1.x
    https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/OldSoftwareReleases
    https://downloads.arduino.cc/arduino-1.8.19-windows.exe
2. Power up board with Uno and ESP01 installed. Power LED (POW) should be lit up.
3. Connect USB cable to Arduino
4. Open the `unit.io` file from the split-flap/Unit folder of the repo
5. In the IDE, go to Tools -> Port and select the appropriate COM port. In my case it was COM3, but maybe than can vary?
6. It should tell you down at the bottom of the IDE if the install was successful.
